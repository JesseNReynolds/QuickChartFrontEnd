# QuickChartFrontEnd

## What?
A simple tool for charting music using the [Nashville Number System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Number_System).
[Short demo video](https://youtu.be/RayplgaGTFY)

## Why?
I wanted a tool to chart in this way, and was learning to make single page webapps with vanilla JS, so that's what I made.

## How?
This is a single page web app that interacts with a back-end rails API available at https://github.com/JesseNReynolds/QuickChartBackEnd .
To run this app, download this repo and the back end repo, and once the rails server is running on your machine, open the index.html file in this repo in your browser.
